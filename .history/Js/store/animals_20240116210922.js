This includes a diverse range, such as 26 spiders (comprising 14 cellar spiders, 7 jumping spiders, 4 crab spiders, and 1 tarantula), 1 scorpion species, 5 mites and ticks, 14 reptiles (13 day geckos and 1 snake), 1 shrub frog, 1 orchid, and 6 lichens. Furthermore, in 2021, Professors Devaka Weerakoon and Amila Sumanapala presented an updated taxonomy list, encompassing findings up to the conclusion of 2020.",

            body1: "The Gray slender loris is a small primate with large, round eyes and long thin limbs. Despite the name, it is not always gray, some of them being quite reddish, and each subspecies (of which there are four) varies in coat color. Like all lorises, each of its digits has a nail, except for the second one of each foot, which has instead a relatively long claw, the ‘toilet’ claw, which it uses when grooming.",

On average, their habitats are situated at an elevation of 3,281 ft (1,000 m).",
