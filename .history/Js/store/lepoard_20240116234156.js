            body: "The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the cat family, Felidae. Distinguished by its well-camouflaged fur, opportunistic hunting behavior, broad diet, strength, and adaptability to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas, the leopard can reach speeds of up to 58 km/h (36 mph). The earliest known leopard fossils excavated in Europe date back approximately 600,000 years, to the late Early Pleistocene. Additionally, leopard fossils have been discovered in Japan and Sumatra. Leopards, scientifically known as Panthera pardus, are majestic big cats renowned for their remarkable agility, strength, and distinctive spotted coat. They inhabit a wide range of ecosystems, from dense forests and savannas to mountainous regions. Solitary and elusive creatures, leopards expertly adapt to various environments with remarkable climbing and swimming abilities. Their coat, adorned with rosettes and spots, serves as effective camouflage, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings while stalking prey. Known for their powerful and precise hunting techniques, leopards are opportunistic carnivores, preying on a diverse array of animals, including antelopes, deer, and smaller mammals. Despite their adaptability and widespread distribution across Africa and parts of Asia, leopards face threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.",

            title: "Leopard Appearance",
            body: "This middle-sized wild cat has a slim and long body with short, sturdy legs and a long tail, helping the animal to keep balance when in the trees. The head is broad and the skull is large, having strong and powerful jaw muscles. The ears are small and round. The eyebrows exhibit long hairs, protecting the eyes of the animal as it moves through dense vegetation. There are also long whiskers, stretching from dark markings on the upper lip of the animal. The overall coloration and markings of their coat greatly depend on the environment. Thus, leopards, living on open grasslands, typically exhibit a light yellow background fur. Meanwhile, the coat of those, found in forests, is usually darker and covered with more markings. The black rosettes, covering their body, are square-like in populations of South Africa, being circular in those of East Africa. The tail is ringed, and the animal has distinct black markings on its face, chest, and feet.",
