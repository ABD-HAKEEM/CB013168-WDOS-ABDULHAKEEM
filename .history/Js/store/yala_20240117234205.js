Its transformation into a conservation area began during the British colonial era, marked by its designation as a game sanctuary in 1900 and later as a national park in 1938. Originally utilized for hunting by the British elite, the park gradually shifted towards conservation. Post-independence, Yala became a crucial wildlife sanctuary, especially renowned for its high leopard population. Today, it stands as a testament to Sri Lanka's commitment to preserving its natural heritage and fostering biodiversity.",
