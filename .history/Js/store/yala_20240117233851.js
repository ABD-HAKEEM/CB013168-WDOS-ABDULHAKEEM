Its transformation into a conservation area began during the British colonial era, marked by its designation as a game sanctuary in 1900 and later as a national park in 1938. Originally utilized for hunting by the British elite, the park gradually shifted towards conservation. Post-independence, Yala became a crucial wildlife sanctuary, especially renowned for its high leopard population. Today, it stands as a testament to Sri Lanka's commitment to preserving its natural heritage and fostering biodiversity.",

They are more active and prefer hunting at night, but they are also somewhat active.during dawn, dusk, and daytime hours. They rarely haul their kills into trees, which is likely due to thelack of intraguild competition and the relative abundance of prey.
